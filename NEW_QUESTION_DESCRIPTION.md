# Production Embedding Service API - Question Description

## Overview

Build a production-ready Flask REST API service that provides text embedding generation, document storage, and similarity search capabilities. This project integrates Google's Gemini embedding model with ChromaDB vector database, implements LRU caching for performance optimization, and supports both text and PDF document processing with comprehensive API documentation using Swagger UI.

## Project Objectives

1. **REST API Development:** Create a professional Flask-based API with proper request/response handling, validation, error management, and comprehensive documentation using Flask-RESTX and Swagger UI.

2. **Vector Database Integration:** Implement persistent document storage using ChromaDB with embedding indexing, metadata management, and efficient similarity search capabilities.

3. **Performance Optimization:** Design and implement LRU caching strategies for embedding generation to reduce API calls and improve response times while tracking cache performance metrics.

4. **Multi-Format Document Processing:** Build robust document ingestion supporting both plain text and PDF files with text extraction, metadata preservation, and file validation.

5. **Production-Ready Architecture:** Implement comprehensive error handling, logging, health checks, configuration management, and service monitoring for enterprise deployment.

6. **API Design Best Practices:** Follow RESTful principles with proper HTTP status codes, request validation, response formatting, and API versioning strategies.

## Key Features to Implement

- RESTful API endpoints for embedding generation, document management, similarity search, and system administration
- ChromaDB integration with persistent storage, collection management, and efficient vector operations
- LRU caching system with configurable cache sizes, hit/miss tracking, and performance monitoring
- PDF text extraction using PyMuPDF with metadata preservation, page processing, and content validation
- Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes, logging, and user-friendly error messages
- Health check endpoints for monitoring service connectivity and external dependency status
- Swagger UI integration for interactive API documentation and testing capabilities

## Challenges and Learning Points

- **API Architecture Design:** Understanding RESTful principles, endpoint design, request/response patterns, and API versioning strategies
- **Vector Database Operations:** Learning ChromaDB concepts including collections, embeddings, metadata, and similarity search algorithms
- **Caching Strategies:** Implementing effective caching patterns, cache invalidation, performance monitoring, and memory management
- **File Processing:** Handling file uploads, validation, text extraction from PDFs, and managing different document formats
- **Production Considerations:** Implementing logging, error handling, health monitoring, configuration management, and deployment readiness
- **Performance Optimization:** Balancing API response times, caching effectiveness, and resource utilization in production environments
- **Service Integration:** Coordinating multiple services including external APIs, databases, and file processing systems

## Expected Outcome

You will create a fully functional, production-ready embedding service API that can handle document ingestion, generate embeddings, perform similarity searches, and provide comprehensive monitoring and management capabilities. The service will demonstrate enterprise-level API development practices and scalable architecture patterns.

## Additional Considerations

- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for secure API access
- Add support for batch processing of multiple documents simultaneously
- Create advanced search features including filtering, boosting, and multi-query processing
- Implement rate limiting and quota management for API usage control
- Add support for different embedding models and configuration options
- Create monitoring dashboards and alerting systems for production deployment
- Consider implementing async processing for handling large document collections
